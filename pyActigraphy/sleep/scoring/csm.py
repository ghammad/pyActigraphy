    """Condor Sleep Model

    Sleep-wake scoring algorithm developed by Condor Instrument for their
    ActTrust and ActLumus devices.

    This algorithm works in a two-step fashion. First, it classifies all epochs
    as wake or rest, as function of each epoch's score. Second, using a more
    stringent scoring threshold, "rest" epoch are re-classified as "sleep". A
    relabelling mechanism using the labels of the surrounding epochs is also
    applied to consolidate periods of epochs labelled as rest or sleep.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : pandas.Series

    wp: array_like
        Array of weights for the epochs after the one being evaluated.
    p_rest: float
        Overall scaling for the weighted moving average used for the scoring
        during the detection of "rest" epochs.
    p_sleep: float
        Overall scaling for the weighted moving average used for the scoring
        during the detection of "sleep" epochs.
    pr_rest: int
        Number of consecutive indexes of the score array that need to be below
        1 to change the state to the "rest" state.
    nr_rest: int
        Number of consecutive indexes of the score array that need to be above
        1 to keep the initial state during the detection of "rest" epochs.
    pr_sleep: int
        Number of consecutive indexes of the score array that need to be below
        1 to change the state to the "sleep" state.
    nr_sleep: int
        Number of consecutive indexes of the score array that need to be above
